# Changelog

All notable changes to bedrock-now are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `./stack models` prints the model table from the last check without calling Bedrock; `--recheck` re-probes.
  Results are saved to `litellm/probe-results.tsv`.
- A third LiteLLM virtual key, `setup` (`BUDGET_SETUP`, default $5), pays for the model probe and the paid
  `./stack test` calls. `./stack test` checks the other keys with free `/key/info` calls.
- `./stack costs` lists the `setup` key and a total across all keys (last 30 days, from `/global/spend`).

### Changed

- Setup and `./stack up` print one line per phase with elapsed time (`==> LiteLLM ready (16s)`) instead of raw
  compose output; on failure they show the last output and service log lines plus a `./stack logs` hint.
  `BEDROCK_NOW_VERBOSE=1` restores the full compose output. Missing images are announced (with size) and
  downloaded up front with progress.
- Setup announces its decisions: each moved port in one line (`port 8080 is in use → using 8083 for Open WebUI`),
  the Open WebUI admin email and where it came from. The "use the AWS key from your environment?" prompt
  defaults to Yes for a long-lived (AKIA…) key.
- The model table fits 100 columns (MODEL, KIND, coloured STATUS, PRICE, short WHY) with one footnote per
  reason and its action. Marketplace and "no access to the model" denials map to one reason.
- `./stack status` is a compact SERVICE / STATE / HEALTH / URL table instead of raw `docker compose ps`.
- `./stack help` marks the commands that call Bedrock and what they cost; `claude-bedrock --help` starts with a
  six-line header about the wrapper, and `--help`/`--version` no longer print the launch cost line or need
  LiteLLM running.
- Budgets are described the same way everywhere: monthly budget (resets on the date shown by `./stack costs`).
- The setup summary shows a `claude-bedrock` command that works as typed (absolute path when the
  `~/.local/bin` link is missing or not on PATH) and a "Try it" line with Haiku (~$0.02).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-12

Initial public release.

- `./stack` CLI (bash 3.2-compatible): `setup`, `up`/`down`, `status`, `logs`, `test`, `costs`,
  `backup`/`restore`, `update`, `rotate-aws`, `uninstall`.
- Docker Compose stack bound to 127.0.0.1: LiteLLM (Bedrock proxy, virtual keys with monthly budgets),
  Open WebUI, Postgres (pgvector), RustFS object store, and a shared MCP server.
- Setup probes which catalog models your AWS key can use (1-token requests, free checks for images)
  and renders the LiteLLM config from `catalog/models.tsv` and `catalog/prices.tsv`.
- `bin/claude-bedrock`: runs Claude Code against Bedrock through LiteLLM without touching plain `claude`.
- Cost transparency: Bedrock prices in `./stack costs` and the Open WebUI model picker, spend per key.
